Note that these research projects are not included in the prebuilt NSL pip
package.

## [A2N](a2n): Attending to Neighbors for Knowledge Graph Inference

The implementations of A2N [1] are provided in the `a2n` folder on a strict "as
is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind. Also, these
implementations may not be compatible with certain TensorFlow versions (such as
2.0 or above) or Python versions.

## [GAM](gam): Graph Agreement Models for Semi-Supervised Learning

The implementations of Graph Agreement Models (GAMs) are provided in the `gam`
folder on a strict "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind.
Also, these implementations may not be compatible with certain TensorFlow
versions (such as 2.0 or above) or Python versions.
